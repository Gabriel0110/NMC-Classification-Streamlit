# NMC-Classification-Streamlit
A Streamlit application for predicting NUT Midline Carcinoma pathology images using a pre-trained ResNet50 model fine-tuned to a self-curated dataset of pathology images.

## About
Please see my original ML project for NMC Classification that this Streamlit version is based off of here: https://github.com/Gabriel0110/NUT-Carcinoma-Pathology-Classification

There you will find my process, analysis, and motivation behind doing this specific project. This Streamlit app uses a pre-trained ResNet50 DL model rather than basic ML models with Scikit-learn in my original project.

## Motivation (pulled from the original project: https://github.com/Gabriel0110/NUT-Carcinoma-Pathology-Classification)
The motivation for this little project was for my best friend Brandon Gordon. I grew up with Brandon since we were in 5th grade, and I am now 24 as of creating this repository -- so we've known each other almost our entire lives. Brandon was sent to the hospital with what seemed to be Pneumonia at first. After some time in the hospital and more tests, tumors were found in his body, and instead of his problem being Pneumonia, he was diagnosed with NUT Midline Carcinoma.

Brandon's cancer progressed incredibly fast. On top of being one of the rarest forms of cancer, NMC is also one of the most aggressive. The average life expectancy after diagnosis, at the time, was two months. A Harvard professor whom specializes in NMC was consulted to assist with the doctors that were working with Brandon to better understand what this cancer is and what the options were.

Over a short period of time, the cancer progressed incredibly fast, despite treatments and testing. Brandon was on multiple painkillers for the pain caused by the cancer, increasing dosage what seemed to be daily. Visiting him, I was able to see the effect this illness had on his body and his mental state. It is something I wouldn't wish on anyone.

August 14th, 2018, the decision was made to end treatment after no sign of improvement, and we were thankfully able to say our goodbyes as he made his peace. On the morning of August 15th, 2018 at 1:10am, Brandon passed away in his sleep. He was 22.

A couple of months prior to this event entering our lives, Brandon, myself, and another lifelong friend were all together after all of us being in different states. We were having great time creating great memories. The thought of one of us getting a rare cancer and dying within months of spending time together was unfathomable, yet, life manages to bring about the most unfortunate of surprises.

My hope is that this rare cancer can have some more light shed on it, and more information gathered to help treat and increase life expectancy of future patients.
