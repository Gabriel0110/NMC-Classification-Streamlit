# NMC-Classification-Streamlit
A Streamlit application for predicting NUT Midline Carcinoma pathology images using a pre-trained ResNet50 model fine-tuned to a self-curated dataset of pathology images.

## About
Please see my original ML project for NMC Classification that this Streamlit version is based off of here: https://github.com/Gabriel0110/NUT-Carcinoma-Pathology-Classification

There you will find my process, analysis, and motivation behind doing this specific project. This Streamlit app uses a pre-trained ResNet50 DL model rather than basic ML models with Scikit-learn in my original project.
